      "description": "Tribalism has deeply influenced Kenyan politics, often turning elections into ethnic contests. Political parties frequently mobilize support along tribal lines, leading to exclusion, favoritism, and sometimes violence. The 2007-2008 post-election violence, which resulted in over 1,000 deaths and displacement of thousands, was a stark manifestation of ethnic tensions.",

      "title": "Social Fragmentation & Institutional Decay",
      "description": "The perpetuation of ethnic stereotypes and competition has fragmented Kenyan society, impeding the development of a unified national identity. Tribalism often fuels mutual suspicion and discrimination in social and economic spheres, while also affecting key institutions such as the judiciary, education, and security services.",
      "examples": [
        "Formation of ethnic enclaves in urban areas",
        "Decreased inter-ethnic marriages and social relationships",
        "Strengthened tribal associations that heighten ethnic competition",

      "detail": "Research in Nakuru from the 1920s-1960s showed urban life consolidated tribal identities and exacerbated differences, while ethnic favoritism in institutions undermines public trust."

      "description": "Tribal loyalties have fostered nepotism and patronage politics, where state resources and appointments are distributed based on ethnicity rather than merit. This undermines governance, public service delivery, and national cohesion, while colonial land policies created lasting economic inequalities between ethnic groups.",

        "Resource allocation and appointments favoring ethnic kin over merit",
